# ECG_Recorder_ESP32
This repository contains code developed as part of my **engineering thesis** at AGH University of Science and Technology.   The project integrates the **BNO055 IMU** (accelerometer + gyroscope) and the **MAX30003 ECG** chip with an **ESP32**, sending sensor data over **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** to an external device.
